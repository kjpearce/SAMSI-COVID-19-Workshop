%%%%%%%%% Initial conditions (normalized by total population of NC)

S0 = 0.5;          %%% half the population assumed susceptible at pandemic "mid-point"
V0 = 0;            %%% vaccinated
E0 = 0.001*S0;     %%% exposed
H0 = 1000/10.49e6; %%% hospitalized
I0 = 10*H0;        %%% infected (symptomatic)
A0 = 0.10*I0;      %%% infected (asymptomatic)

X0 = [S0; V0; E0; A0; I0; H0]; 

%%%%%%%%% Parameter values (Scenario 2)

sigma  = 0.82;
gamma  = 0.29;
